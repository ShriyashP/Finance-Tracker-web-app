##  AI Chatbot Integration (RAG with Chatling AI)

To make the app smarter, a no-code RAG-style chatbot was integrated using Chatling AI:

### RAG Architecture Breakdown

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Uploaded finance docs or generated Q&A-style knowledge base |
| 2 | Captured user queries using a text input block |
| 3 | Retrieved relevant content from the KB |
| 4 | Generated contextual response using an LLM |
| 5 | Looped conversation for natural back-and-forth |

> Example queries: "How much did I spend on food last month?" or "What's my biggest spending category?"
